                  closed and reopened, the storage is saved. There is no

                  session lasts as long as the tab or the browser is open.
                  Therefore, when you open a new tab or a new window, this
                  creates a new session and new storage.

            <h1>what is JavaScript EventLoop?</h1>
            <p>
              The event loop is the secret behind JavaScript’s asynchronous
              programming. JS executes all operations on a single thread, but
              using a few smart data structures, it gives us the illusion of
              multi-threading. Let’s take a look at what happens on the
              back-end..
            </p>

            <p><strong>there are many steps to compile a program?</strong></p>
            <p>
              <strong>call stack: </strong> The call stack is responsible for
              keeping track of all the operations in line to be executed.
              Whenever a function is finished, it is popped from the stack.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>event queue: </strong>The event queue is responsible for
              sending new functions to the stack for processing. It follows the
              queue data structure to maintain the correct sequence in which all
              operations should be sent for execution.
            </p>
            <p>
              Whenever an async function is called, it is sent to a browser API.
              These are APIs built into the browser. Based on the command
              received from the call stack, the API starts its own
              single-threaded operation. An example of this is the setTimeout
              method. When a setTimeout operation is processed in the stack, it
              is sent to the corresponding API which waits till the specified
              time to send this operation back in for processing. Where does it
              send the operation? The event queue. Hence, we have a cyclic
              system for running async operations in JavaScript. The language
              itself is single-threaded, but the browser APIs act as separate
              threads. The event loop facilitates this process; it constantly
              checks whether or not the call stack is empty. If it is empty, new
              functions are added from the event queue. If it is not, then the
              current function call is processed.
